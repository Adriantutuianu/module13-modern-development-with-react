        We shall say 'Ni' again to you, if you do not appease us. We want a shrubbery!! You can't expect to wield supreme power just 'cause some watery tart threw a sword at you! No, no, no! Yes, yes. A bit. But she's got a wart. The swallow may fly south with the sun, and the house martin or the plover may seek warmer climes in winter, yet these are not strangers to our land. Knights of Ni, we are but simple travelers who seek the enchanter who lives beyond these woods.
